# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

**Each Pull Request sent should comply to this, if somewhat violation is noticed later, it can be labelled as `Invalid` or `Spam`, so, read this carefully.**

# ADDING NEW COMPONENTS :

- Your component should be contained under desired Folder (eg: '"Navigation"' for a navigation bar or '"Slideshow" for a Slideshow').
- Your folder name should be "exsiting folders + 1" (eg: you are adding a new navigation bar and the '"Navigation"' folder is empy then your file name  should be "navigationbar-1" and suppose if few items exists and the last folder name is "navigationbar-5" then your filename should be "navigationbar-6".
- Each File ("name-of-component") should contain `author : your-name` and `link : your-solution-link` as comments at the begining of the file.
- You can add one file preferably named as `explain.md` which will contain the code explanations.
- We expect `components` should be well documented to explain the purpose of the codes.
- Solutions should be `properly indented`.
- All thhe components must use bootstrap library.
- Component should be strictly designed by you, Code from codepen(that doesn't belong to you) are not accepted and will be marked invalid if evidence found.

# DOCUMENTATION CONTRIBUTION:

You may contribute to the README or any of the documentation files if you want to improve it. We will be happy to update useful changes.

# IMPORTANT POINTS BEFORE SENDING PULL REQUESTS:

- Your `Solution` should be strictly in the `"filename.html"` file, otherformats are not accepted
- Maintainers should be able to update changes.
- The `e.md` should not include any **LOGIC or IDEA** for solving the problem.
- **More emphasis is given on understanding the logic used to get the solution rather than the code itself**. Hence simply copy-pasting code is not encouraged.
- Authenticity is expected and respected for every PULL REQUEST(s).

**You can expect your PR(s) to get merged if you follow the points and we expect alot of contributions from your end to make this repository a powerful one, raising the standards!!! ðŸ˜€ðŸ”¥**

**Happy Contributing DEVs** :wink:
